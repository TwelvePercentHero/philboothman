The goal in building this website is to create a lightweight, low-dependency Wordpress theme for my personal website. It's also designed to be an iterative build, where I start by building the most basic site I can, using it until I find something I am unable to do, and then build it out further.

The site is my personal online playground for all kinds of different work, from writing to videos to digital art to web design, a place where I can mess around abd break things and be messy without feeling the need to perfect everything.
