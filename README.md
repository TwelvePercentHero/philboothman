The goal in building this website is to create a lightweight, low-dependency Wordpress theme for my personal website. It's also designed to be an iterative build, where I start by building the most basic site I can, using it until I find something I am unable to do, and then build it out further.

The site is my personal online playground for all kinds of different work, from writing to videos to digital art to web design, a place where I can mess around abd break things and be messy without feeling the need to perfect everything. That means that the content is the most important thing and I'm not too concerned about having a flashy design that distracts from that.

## Tech Used

**VSCode with php linting** - For writing and debugging code

## Version History

### 05/09/2020

Started the project in earnest, initialising the functions and putting in a very basic layout.

### 07/09/2020

Started at the top with the header, following fairly basic standards for a navbar including a main icon and a responsive hamburger icon for the menu. Not overly happy with this approach as I'm just going along with things that I'm used to, so it's definitely up for a change in future. Used Material Icons for the hamburger as a shortcut but want to explore doing it using an SVG to cut down on dependencies.

### 08/09/2020

As expected, threw out the hamburger icon and collapsible nav menu in favour of a set of links - not my first instinct as it feels a little 'old internet' to have the standard blue underlined hyperlinks, but I think in terms of accessibility this approach is looking a lot better. It also does away with a small amount of JavaScript which makes everything feel a little leaner.

Used guidance from [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/) to make the footer sticky, and followed a similar approach for the footer links.

Created a basic page template and links to play around with navigation and information architecture.
